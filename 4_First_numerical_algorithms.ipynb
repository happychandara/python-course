    "This first introductory example will illustrate that testing an equality of `float` variables is complicated. Since a lot of approximations are made when calculating using `float` variables, the condition `x == y` doesn't make much sense and will generally always be false : we prefer testing the condition that `x` and `y` are \"close from each other\" in a sense we will precise later.<br>\n",
