    "In this class, we will create a tic-tac-toe game in Python. The goal is to create two different modes : one where two players play against each other and one where a single player plays against the computer.<br>\n",
    "The grid will be displayed in the shell after each move and the game will ask players where they want to play. When someone wins, a message will announce the winner and if the game is a draw, a message will de displayed as well.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "You're free to code the game however you like ! Make use of functions, loops, conditional statements, lists and everything else that you have learnt until now in order to do so. :)"

    "- Proceed step by step : start thinking of a way to represent the grid and to display it, then identify the winning combination, then think of how to make the players play turn by turn, etc...\n",
    "- Start by only coding the 2 players mode (do you necessarily need to proceed differently during the turns of player 1 and player 2 ?), then adapt the code for the single player mode.\n",
    "- If you want to do a specific thing but don't know any function that allows you to do so : do research ! \n",
    "- Implement upgrades once you have a functionnal game : ensure the player enters a valid cell number, add some cosmetics, a cool opening screen, etc...\n",
    "- Most importantly : have fun and feel free to add any other feature that you think would be interesting, make the game your own !"
